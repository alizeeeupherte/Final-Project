# Valuying the water under our feet

In order to carry out a project that works over time, I placed myself in 2100 by taking into account the rise in water with a higher level of submersion of 2 meters.
How to value the flood risk through a remarkable site? In order to sensitize the population to this phenomenon,
I found it useful to illustrate it through a public museum.

In a first step, the redevelopment of the quays of these three towns studied between the meeting of the Seine, more industrial and the Marne, more poetic, makes it possible to arrive on the site with ease, even in times of submersion.

A whole work of recovery of the existing is put in place in order to limit the deconstruction. It is a meticulous operation between point of view and level games.

The program is then multiple. The plot is first of all open to the district by its public square with its sports or relaxation facilities.
Through the existing part of the preserved building, I decided to install an open space for high-end water sales on the ground floor as well as a co-working level upstairs.
For the extension and the museum part, the idea is to combine a fun and constructive workshop while creating views and a walk through the building. All grouping together towards an accessible roof terrace and its night program: an ice bar.
